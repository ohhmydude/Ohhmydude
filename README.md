- 👋 Hello, I’m Sneha
- I’m currently working on Pose Estimation and Machine Translation.
Tech Stack: Keras, TensorFlow, OpenCV

- Research Areas: Intelligent Systems(AI/ML, NLP, Speech, Text), Blockchain Technology

- Work Done: 

      Sentence Similarity 
      
      Natural Language Processing
      
      • Analysed various sentence similarity algorithms and performed performance measurements using python.
      • Focused more on Semantic Similarity than Syntactic to create a fast and accurate retrieval system. Done analysis on SICK
      Dataset and achieved an accuracy of 95.4 percent.


      POS TAGGING

      Natural Language Processing
      • Build a POS tagger to distinguish the various meaning of the
      same word at different places by using HMM.
      • Done analysis on Viterbi algorithm to make the retrieval system
      fast and accurate.

      Blockchain – A Public Distribution System

      Blockchain, Python, Firebase
      • Developed a Public Distribution System using Blockchain
      Technology.
      • Implemented Blockchain using Python and add Firebase to
      store all the transactions.
